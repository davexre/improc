1. Ensure you close any existing skype instance(check by ps aux and kill -9 skype_PID).
2. Delete the HomeServer tag in config.xml. Either empty the tag or delete the line should works.
3. Start the skype. It should works now.
4. Check config.xml again, the tag should automatically updated with new hostname.
5. If you test with this new hostname with traceroute, it should go to last line which are not ***.
