Compiling:
==========

If using the default maven settings, i.e.

	mvn clean package

the target/dbtools.jar will contain drivers for Oracle and SQLite only.

In case other drivers are needed use respectively

	mvn clean package -P mysql,mssql,derby,hsqldb,h2

In order to include all jdbcs in the target jar use:

	mvn package -Dalljdbc
